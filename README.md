# Plutocracy is still bad

Plutocracy in DPoS consensus mechanisms and Ethereum presents significant problems wherein token holders have to vote to elect a limited number of delegates who validate transactions and create blocks. Plutocratic concerns remain in Ethereum due to validator requirements, staking pools, and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) where wealthier actors can more effectively extract value from the network through specialized infrastructure and strategies.

Although the consensus algorithm enables efficient block production and security, users should be aware of the fact that this particular DPoS system also suffers from plutocratic tendencies where validators may form cartels to maintain their positions and distribute rewards among themselves.
